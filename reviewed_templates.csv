E118,13,total of <*> ddr error(s) detected and corrected,"Based on the review of the provided template and the style of the previous samples, here are the observations and suggestions for optimization:

1. **Symbol Errors**: There are no symbol errors in the template.
2. **Variable Recognition Errors**: The placeholder `<*>` correctly represents a variable, but the term ""error(s)"" should be consistent with the singular or plural form based on the variable's value. Therefore, it would be better to separate the variable for the count and the term ""error(s)"" to ensure proper grammar.

### Revised Template:
**Revised_template**: total of <*> ddr error(s) detected and corrected

### Optimization Suggestion:
To improve clarity and consistency, it is recommended to revise the template to explicitly handle singular and plural forms. Here’s an optimized version:

**Optimized Template**: total of <*> ddr error detected and corrected | total of <*> ddr errors detected and corrected

This way, it can accommodate both singular and plural forms based on the variable's value."
E28,21,"ciod: Error loading <*>: invalid or missing program image, No such file or directory","Based on the provided template and the example log, here are the optimization suggestions:

1. **Symbol Errors**: There are no symbol errors in the template.
2. **Variable Recognition Errors**: The placeholder `<*>` is correctly used to represent a variable (the file path in this case). However, the message ""invalid or missing program image, No such file or directory"" is a static part of the log and does not need to be included as a variable.

**Revised Template**: 
```plaintext
ciod: Error loading <*>, invalid or missing program image, No such file or directory

This revised template maintains consistency with the original log while ensuring that the variable is correctly recognized."
E98,3,program interrupt,"Based on the style of the previous samples, the template ""program interrupt"" does not contain any placeholders for variables. Since the original log example is also ""program interrupt,"" it suggests that there might be no variable data to capture.

Here are the optimization suggestions:

1. **Variable Recognition**: If ""program interrupt"" is a specific event that can occur with different contexts or additional information, it would be beneficial to include placeholders for any relevant variables that could accompany this log entry. For example, if there are specific identifiers or statuses associated with the interrupt, those should be included.

2. **Consistency**: If the event can have variations (e.g., ""program interrupt occurred,"" ""program interrupt detected""), consider capturing those variations in the template.

Given the current information, if no additional context or variables are identified, the optimized template would remain the same. However, if you want to prepare for potential variations, a suggested template could be:

**Optimized Template**: program interrupt <*>

This allows for the inclusion of any additional context or identifiers if they become relevant in future logs."
E90,6,Node card is not fully functional,"Based on the style of the previous samples, the template ""Node card is not fully functional"" does not contain any placeholders for variables, which is inconsistent with the other templates reviewed. Since the log indicates a specific issue with the node card, it could benefit from including a placeholder for additional context, such as the node identifier or any relevant status information.

Here’s the optimized template suggestion:

**Optimized Template:** Node card <*> is not fully functional

This optimization introduces a placeholder to capture specific information about the node card, making the template more flexible and applicable to different instances of the log."
E21,1,ciod: Error creating node map from file <*>: Bad file descriptor,"Based on the provided template and example, here are the optimization suggestions:

1. **Symbol Errors**: There are no symbol errors in the template.
2. **Variable Recognition Errors**: The placeholder `<*>` correctly represents a variable (the file path). There are no unrecognized variables.

However, the revised template should ensure that it matches the format of the original log more closely. The original log contains a specific structure that includes a colon after ""file"" and a space before the error message ""Bad file descriptor"". 

### Revised Template:
`ciod: Error creating node map from file <*>: Bad file descriptor`

This revised template maintains the original structure and ensures that the placeholders are correctly placed.

1. **Symbol Errors**: There are no symbol errors in the template. The placeholders are correctly formatted.

2. **Variable Recognition Errors**: The placeholders are correctly representing the variables in the log. However, the specific format of the 'dcr' value in the example suggests that it might be beneficial to clarify the format of the 'dcr' variable in the template.

3. **Inconstant Label**: The template should ensure consistency in how the 'dcr' variable is represented. In the example, it is shown as 'dcr 0x02f0', which indicates it may need to be enclosed in parentheses or brackets to maintain consistency with other logs that may have similar structures.

**Revised Template**: 
```
<*> torus receiver z+ input pipe error(s) (dcr <*>) detected and corrected
```

**Optimization Template**: 
```
<*> torus receiver z+ input pipe error(s) (dcr <*>) detected and corrected
```

In this case, the template does not require changes since it already follows the correct format. However, if you want to enforce a specific format for the 'dcr' variable, you could consider adding a note in documentation or specifying the expected format for clarity."
E20,1,ciod: duplicate canonical-rank <*> to logical-rank <*> mapping at line <*> of node map file <*>,"Based on the review of the provided template and example log, here are the optimization suggestions:

1. **Symbol Errors**: The template appears to have no symbol errors.
2. **Variable Recognition Errors**: The placeholders in the template seem to correctly represent the variables in the example log. However, the last placeholder `<*>` should be enclosed in parentheses to match the example log's structure.

Here is the optimized template:

1. **Symbol Errors**: There are no symbol errors in the template.
2. **Variable Recognition Errors**: The placeholder `<*>` correctly represents a variable (the file path in this case). There are no other variables that have not been recognized.

However, to maintain consistency with the previous samples, we should ensure that the revised template matches the structure of the original log more closely. The original log contains a specific file path, and the template should reflect that.

**Revised Template**: 
`ciod: Error creating node map from file <*>, Permission denied`

This revised template adds a comma before ""Permission denied"" to match the structure of the original log more accurately. 

**Final Optimization Template**: 
`ciod: Error creating node map from file <*>, Permission denied`"

1. **Symbol Errors**: The template appears to have no symbol errors. The placeholders are correctly formatted as `<*>`.

2. **Variable Recognition Errors**: 
   - The placeholders seem to be correctly representing the variables in the log. However, the last placeholder `<*>` should specify that it represents a file path. This could enhance clarity and ensure consistency with the previous samples.

3. **Inconstant Label**: The template is consistent with the original log, but it may benefit from explicitly stating that the last placeholder is a file path.

Revised Template:
```
